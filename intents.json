KMIT has tailored it to meet its needs and uses it on multiple networks. Tessellator offers two modules: After each programming class, students take a quiz with multiple-choice questions, followed by a form with guidelines to write code (e.g., JAVA, C) related to the class. Slow learners may work on a single program, while fast learners can advance to the third program. KMIT has extended Moodle's capabilities to include code compilation techniques for JAVA, C, and other programming languages."
